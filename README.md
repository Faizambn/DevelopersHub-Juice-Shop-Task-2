## 📋 Overview

This repository showcases the security-hardening phase of OWASP Juice Shop, completed during Weeks 4–6 of the DevelopersHub Internship Program. The focus is on transforming a vulnerable application into a secure, production-grade platform using advanced security techniques, ethical hacking, and comprehensive audits.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Deploy real-time threat detection and monitoring
* Secure APIs with modern authentication and rate limiting
* Perform ethical hacking and patch discovered vulnerabilities
* Conduct full-spectrum security audits and compliance checks
* Harden Docker deployment and CI/CD security
* Ensure 100% alignment with OWASP Top 10 standards

## 🚀 Key Enhancements

### Week 4: Threat Detection & Web Security

* ✅ Real-time intrusion detection (Fail2Ban, OSSEC)
* ✅ API rate limiting and JWT-based authentication
* ✅ Secure CORS policy and CSP implementation
* ✅ HTTP security headers (via Helmet)
* ✅ Alerts for suspicious activity

### Week 5: Ethical Hacking & Exploitation

* ✅ Kali Linux environment for ethical testing
* ✅ SQL Injection detection and mitigation
* ✅ CSRF protection and secure session handling
* ✅ Input sanitization and validation

### Week 6: Auditing & Deployment

* ✅ Security testing using OWASP ZAP, Nikto, and Lynis
* ✅ 100% OWASP Top 10 compliance verified
* ✅ Hardened Docker containers
* ✅ CI/CD integration with security scanning
* ✅ Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Node.js 14+
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Git

### 🛠️ Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/notfawadmir/Juice-Shop-Part-2.git
cd developershub-security

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.Juice-Shop-Part-2 .env
# (Edit the .env file as needed)

# Run initial setup
npm run security:setup

# Start the app
npm start
```

### 🐳 Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build secure Docker image
docker build -t juice-shop-secure .

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🔐 Key Security Features

### ✅ JWT Authentication Middleware

```js
const authenticateJWT = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization')?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Access denied' });

  try {
    const verified = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = verified;
    next();
  } catch {
    res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
};
```

### 📉 Rate Limiting

```js
const rateLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100,
  message: 'Too many requests'
});
```

### 🛡️ Security Headers

```js
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true
  }
}));
```
